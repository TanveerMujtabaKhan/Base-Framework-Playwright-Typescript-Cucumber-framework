# Playwright-Typescript-Cucumber-framework

## Overview  
The "Playwright-Typescript-Cucumber-framework" is a robust test automation framework leveraging Playwright, TypeScript, and Cucumber to validate UI and API functionalities across multiple brands such as brand1 and brand2. Built with a Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) approach, it ensures test cases are readable, maintainable, and aligned with business requirements, supporting desktop testing with extensibility for mobile scenarios.

- **UI and API Testing**: Integrates Playwright for browser automation and supports API validation.  
- **Localization**: Validates UI in English, French, and Chinese.  
- **Dynamic Configuration**: Uses environment variables (`ENV`, `BRAND`) for flexible test runs.  
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Generates HTML reports with screenshots for failed, undefined, or skipped steps.  
- **Scalability**: Efficient for large test suites (e.g., 1000 cases) with minimal performance impact.
